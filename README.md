# About this project
This is a final year project on investigating deep learning models for [Hong Kong Mahjong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong). 

The project consists of 2 stages.

In the 1st stage, various models were implemented. These include heuristics based, Monte-Carlo tree search based, Deep Q learning based and Deep policy gradient based models.

In the 2nd stage, the models were benchmarked by making them compete with each other. A Telegram bot was also built to benchmarking against human players.
